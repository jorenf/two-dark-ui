> Syntax theme: [Civic][2]

### Settings

In the theme settings you can switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.
2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.
3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.

As well as change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.

### FAQ

__Why do the colors change when I switch Syntax themes?__
This UI theme uses the same background color as the chosen Syntax theme. In case that Syntax theme has a light background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays dark. This lets you use light-dark combos.
